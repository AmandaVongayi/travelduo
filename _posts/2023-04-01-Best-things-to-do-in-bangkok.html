    QUEENSLAND & NEW SOUTH WALES make up Australia's famous, and simply

The whole country is full of every awesome thing under the sun that you can think of. There are beautiful beaches, rainforests, unique wildlife, outrageous reefs, surf and national parks.</p><p><strong>So what draws people to the East Coast of Australia?</strong></p><p>Having driven the ultimate road trip in Australia, an entire lap (37,000 km). We think we have an answer...and simply put, It's the easiest way to see as much as possible. Nothing could have prepared us for how big Australia is, and anyone who would like to travel to Australia will always have to cram a lot in. If you only have time for a 3 weeks itinerary then this is the trip for you, because you can definitely travel Australia's east coast during that time.</p><p>I would start thinking about how you ask your boss for a three week holiday so you can go and see what all the fuss is about. Here is our ideal itinerary that will help you plan your trip to perfection.&nbsp;</p><p>\_</p><p><!-- x-tinymce/html --></p>"

      <h2><!-- x-tinymce/html --></h2><h3>HOW EASY IS IT TO GET AROUND
      AUSTRALIA?<!-- x-tinymce/html --></h3><p>The best way to travel East Coast
      Australia, and the whole country in general, is by driving. That could be
      in a 4wd, camper van or car. If you're tight on time then there are other
      options, but driving gives you the most freedom by far. Sure, you may have
      to look out for the odd kangaroo hopping down a stretch of road, but
      that's part of the Aussie experience. In case you need alternatives, here
      are the best options for any trip around Australia.&nbsp;</p><p><!--

        <p><strong>Camper van</strong>: Hands down, the winner for us. It puts
        you right in the driver's seat of your own adventure. Nothing beats the
        freedom that comes from going wherever you want. You can stay longer if
        you fall in love with somewhere, or leave early if it doesn't quite hit
        the spot.</p><p>If you're visiting for 3 weeks then renting a camper van
        is the best option. It's a little expensive, but it's your travel,
        accommodation and kitchen for the duration of the trip.</p><p><a

        <p><strong>4-wheel drive</strong>: In a 4-wheel drive there is no end to
        where you can go. That added freedom does come at a cost because you
        will forgo some luxury. You have to sleep in a tent rather than in a
        cosy camper van, but it's a small price to pay.</p><p>In truth, it would
        be a bit of a waste along the East Coast because there isn't much you
        can't do in a camper van anyway. Why not live in a little more luxury?
        If your mind is made up then a 4-wheel drive adventure in Australia
        would be awesome!</p>

        href="https://www.greyhound.com.au/national-whimit-passes">Greyhound
        Whimit Pass</a></strong>: Beloved by backpackers as they travel the east
        coast! It's a hop-on, hop-off bus service that gets you to all the most
        popular destinations. If you're looking at anything remote then this
        won't take you there. It only gets you to the area, so you still have to
        book accommodation and tours, and even rent a car to see the
        sights.</p><p>It doesn't cover every part of Australia. It goes up and
        down the East Coast, between Darwin and Adelaide and only to Broome in
        Western Australia. &nbsp;It's a valid option but depends on what route
        your Australia itinerary will take.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Fly:</strong> If you're tight on time in Australia then this
        is the fastest way of getting around. It is the most expensive option,
        and you are limited to getting to places with airports. You'd still need
        a car, van or Greyhound to get to what you want to see. If you flew
        straight into somewhere like Hamilton Island in the Whitsunday Islands
        to spend a week or two then it's a great option.&nbsp;</p><p><a

    textarea_html: "<h2><!-- x-tinymce/html --></h2><h3>BEST TIME OF YEAR TO VISIT AUSTRALIA</h3><p>Due to its size, there are different climates across Australia. In the South, it follows 4 seasons throughout the year. In the north, it's a tropical climate with wet and dry seasons. The best time to travel the Australian East Coast is between August and December. That way it won't be too cold in Sydney, or too hot by the time you reach Cairns. It's still going to be very warm in Cairns in December, but it can get way hotter. Unless you're already from a very warm country then you will not want to be up that far north after December.</p><p>\_</p><p><!--{C}%3C!%2D%2D%20x-tinymce%2Fhtml%20%2D%2D%3E--></p><h3>WHERE TO STAY?</h3><p>There are tonnes of free campsites in Australia, and plenty along the East Coast. This is where a camper van helps because it can keep costs down while living the van life of your dreams. They don't usually come with showers and kitchen areas etc. so be prepared for a free cold shower or to cook in/ outside of your van if needs be. It helps to get there while it's still bright outside for cooking etc.</p><p>Staying in the occasional hostel can be good for shaking things up if you want a break from van life. When you live in a van even the cheapest of hostels will seem more luxurious than before, and they're a great way to meet people.&nbsp;</p><p><!-- x-tinymce/html --></p>"

      ITINERARY</h3><p><!-- x-tinymce/html --></p><p><!-- x-tinymce/html
      --></p><p>Here it is! our ultimate 3 week itinerary to see the best of
      East Coast Australia. 3 weeks in Australia isn't a whole lot of time to
      see such a large coastline. This travel itinerary will be going from
      Sydney to Cairns and will have stops at all the most amazing places in
      Australia as you cruise along the coast. It may seem hectic, but each day
      is guaranteed to be full of adventure.</p>
  - _section-type: text-block
    textarea_html: >-
      <h3><strong>Week 1</strong></h3><p>Our 3 week Australia itinerary starts
      in Sydney, the unofficial capital of Australia. You can see Sydney in a
      day trip if you wanted to get going towards all the awesome natural
      wonders. If you're happy to hang around for a few days then you'll have an
      amazing time soaking up the city life. This is the largest of the must-see
      cities in Australia, so there is a lot to do. you have the usual touristy
      stuff:&nbsp; Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Sydney Opera House, Bondi
      Beach...you know the spots. Once you've had your fill it's time to leave
      Sydney behind and start working our way up towards Brisbane and Cairns.
      Like any great coastal cruise, there will be a bunch of stops at all the
      most awesome sights on our east coast road trip.</p>

        <h4><!-- x-tinymce/html --></h4><h4><!-- x-tinymce/html --></h4><p>On
        your way up North, Coffs Harbour is a great seaside town for a day trip,
        but don't stay too long because you do not want to miss Byron Bay. It's
        where you'll find some of the best surfing in Australia, chilled vibes
        and awesome times. Byron is one of our favourite places in Australia and
        somewhere you must stop on your east coast adventure. You could even run
        into Chris Hemsworth if you're lucky! You can walk to the most eastern
        point in Australia here. Once there you'll be greeted by some amazing
        coastal views of the waves crashing against the towering
        cliffs.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Top Tip: Make sure to visit<a
        href="https://goo.gl/maps/N8dG7riweuC8ik9f9"> The Balcony Bar</a>
        on a Wednesday for half-price oysters served on a bed of ice if you love

        Byron Bay, but a warm hello to another vibey city in Australia...The
        Gold Coast! It's an incredible city where skyscrapers line the beach and
        surfers reign supreme. They literally have an area called Surfers
        Paradise after all. Next up is Brisbane, and there are a few things you
        can do here. The famous Australia Zoo is about an hour's drive out of
        the city. We would recommend jumping on a<a

        tour in Brisbane</a>, it's where we saw a bunch of humpback whales.
        No joking, there must have been around 10 pods!</p><p>Make sure to keep
        your time in the cities to a minimum because next, we're going to be
        spending a few days on<a

        Fraser Island</a>. Only 4-wheel drive vehicles can get to Fraser

        book a tour</a>. Cruising along the beaches and through the
        rainforests here is EPIC! If you can budget the time then 3 nights here
        would be perfect, but you can also do it in a day trip if needs
        be.&nbsp;</p>

Head straight to The Whitsundays Islands in The Great Barrier Reef where you can take a sailing trip to the world-famous Whitehaven Beach. The Great Barrier Reef is the perfect place to enjoy some outstanding snorkelling.

There's a great free campsite nearby too.</p><p>It's time to finish our trip by arriving in Cairns and making your way to the iconic Gilligans for a wild night.

      <h2><!-- x-tinymce/html --></h2><h3>OTHER POPULAR ROUTES</h3><p><!--
      x-tinymce/html --></p><p>Finding other trips for an Australia 3 week
      itinerary is pretty tough, because of how massive the country is. Driving
      between Sydney and Melbourne is another popular trip. You can do it in a
      much smaller deadline if you're pressed for time. From Melbourne, you can
      see the Great Ocean Road and then head across to Sydney. You could even
      keep heading West from Melbourne into South Australia.&nbsp;</p><p>In
      truth, having 3 weeks to travel the West Coast is not enough time. The
      distances between things are a lot greater, and each drive takes way more
      planning. In Western Australia, it's not uncommon to have 500 km between
      petrol stations. Unlike the Sunshine Coast which has plenty of stops,
      stations and places with phone data.</p>
