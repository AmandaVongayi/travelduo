      <p>Welcome to the digital nomad's paradise—Chiang Mai, Thailand! With its
      vibrant culture, affordable living costs, and incredible WiFi speeds, this
      city has become a haven for remote workers from all around the world and
      for good reason! What better way to get your creative juices flowing than
      by working in one of Chiang Mai's fantastic cafes? Here are our top 10
      cafes to work, sip on a delicious matcha latte, and soak in the unique
      atmosphere of this charming city.</p> <h4>Sunday Baker</h4> <p>The
      absolute number one place for us was ‘Sunday Baker’. We stumbled upon this
      place by accident while searching Google Maps for the best places to have
      breakfast. This place is nice and quiet for working and feels like an
      absolute hidden gem. They specialize in everything matcha and nailed the
      art of croissant making like they do in France. </p> <p>Seating: really
      comfortable chairs <br /> Internet speed: 95 mb/s <br /> Power plugs: They
      have a few <br /> Food recommendation: Amaaaazing food! You should
      definitely try the croissants! Our favourite was the salmon scramble. They
      also make the best matcha lattes.</p>

      most comfortable chairs. Fine for a day though! <br> Internet speed: 470

      <h4>Brown</h4> <p>Located in the trendy Nimman area, Brown Cafe offers an
      excellent work environment with a cozy and modern atmosphere. This cafe
      provides a variety of seating options, including comfortable sofas,
      communal tables, and individual workstations. While it might not be the
      best for having lunch, it’s perfect for having a little snack and a bubble
      tea. We even got a free Mochi! </p> <p>Seating: Great seating, really
      comfy! <br>Internet speed: 230 mb/s <br> Power plugs: There were lots of

      <h4>Artisan</h4> <p>We loved the vibe and interior of Artisan Cafe. With
      their concrete pillars and brown leather couches it kind of feels like a
      living room while being hipster at the same time. It was also the perfect
      spot to chill close to the immigration office (where we spent hours haha).
      It has incredible coffee and is very quiet and great for getting work
      done. While they do have a menu with some food it’s more for a coffee and
      a croissant.</p> <p>Seating: Veeeery comfortable <br> Internet speed: 108
      mb/s <br> Power plugs: There are some <br> Food recommendation: We didn’t
      eat here.</p>

      <h4>Fern forest cafe</h4> <p>We found this cafe on our last day so sadly
      we could only go there once, but we loved it so much and think it deserves
      a spot here. The food was really, really good. Their courtyard is
      beautiful and perfect if you need to work but want to spend some time in
      nature.</p> <p>Seating: Okay <br>Internet speed: 330 mb/s <br> Power
      plugs: None <br> Food recommendation: The tuna bagel <br> Wifi password:
