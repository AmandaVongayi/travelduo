    textarea_html: <p>For us, food is linked to our experience of a destination. Amazing food can make our day, whereas shitty food will make us annoyed at best and give us diarrhoea at worst. And not even talking about food poisoning?! We spent hours and hours behind our laptops, searching frantically for the best spots to eat. Since we are traveling full-time, living as digital nomads, we sometimes stay weeks in one place. This gives us the opportunity to try lots of places and only our top picks make it to our blog. If you crave local food, Western food or you just want to find those 'trendy' cafes, we've got you covered!</p>
