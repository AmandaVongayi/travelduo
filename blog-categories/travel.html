    textarea_html: <p>Planning Trips can be hard and extremely time consuming!</p> <p>We spent hours behind our laptops, searching frantically for the best spots to go, eat and work. Since we are travelling full time, living as digital nomads, we sometimes stay weeks in one place</p><p>this gives us the opportunity to try lots of places and only our top picks make it to our blog. This way you wont lose time eating at shitty restaurants, visiting over-hyped places or spending way too much time searching where to go</p>
