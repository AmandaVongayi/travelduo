      <h3 class = "center" style = "font-size: 2rem;">Nice to meet you!</h3><p
      class = "left">We are Roel and Eline, also known as Trendy Travel Duo on
      social media. We are a photo- and videographer couple from The Netherlands
      who make content showcasing the best of what the world has to offer, from
      breathtaking landscapes to incredible experiences.</p> <p class =
      "left">Online, we love showing the world through our eyes as well as show
      our day to day lives working remotely around the globe and inspire others
      to make the most of their 20s and 30s. It doesn't matter if you are an
      entrepreneur or have a 9-5. While working remote you can have the best of
      both worlds: travel, really experience a place and culture while at the
      same time keep making an income.</p><p class = "left">On our blog we share
      all our tips and insiders info about different destinations and remote
      work. We are both huge foodies and also love sharing all our favourite
      restaurants and cafes.</p><p class = "left">We believe that travel is not
      just a means of escape, but can be a way of life, to enrich and broaden
      our perspectives. We'll promise to show you around and take you on an
      incredible adventure!</p>

      <p>With Eline having years experience as a marketeer and Roel in sales, we
      are the perfect fit in our relationship as well as business partners ;)
      While Eline takes care of the creative side with editing and designing,
      Roel loves the business side with outreaching as well as keeping our inbox
      to 0. Ofcourse, shooting the content is a thing we both love to do!</p>

      <p class = "justify"> Letâ€™s seeâ€¦ I cannot go a day without chocolate or
      hugs, I hate making choices, I love being creative and I am happiest when
      I am at a tropical destination preferably on a boat or at the beach. Also,
      Iâ€™m obsessed with reading and currently finish about a book per week.
      </p><p class = "left">Something almost nobody knows about me is that Iâ€™m
      easily scared or nervous about lots of things, while it may not look like
      it from the outside. This is where Roel is my laid back opposite ðŸ˜‹
      Although many things might scare me, I taught myself to be brave and do
      all the things Iâ€™m scared or nervous about nonetheless. Life starts
      outside of your comfort zone and many things arenâ€™t as bad as you think
      they will be. This amazing life I have today wouldnâ€™t be possible if I
      didnâ€™t do all those scary things. </p><p class="left">I am also the one
      planning all our trips as I love to make lists of everything (Yes, Iâ€™m a
      Virgo). Maybe that's also why I'm a horrible perfectionist and can never
      stick to just one hobby... I love figure skating, acroyoga, kizomba,
      photography and videography. That probably sums it up quite nicely!</p>

        <h3>Who is Roel?</h3><p class="justify">That tall guy? Thatâ€™s me! I
        cannot be missed ðŸ˜‰ I am someone who actually likes going to the gym. It
        clears my head and makes me feel great afterwards. I used to play rugby
        and loved it, but had to stop because of the many injuries I got from
        it. Also, Iâ€™m obsessed with cheesecake and will eat it in every country
        possible.</p> <p class="justify">One of the most fun things I like doing
        is connecting with people from all over the world. Growing up in
        different countries and speaking several languages undoubtedly helped a
        little with that. Every person Iâ€™ve met has a unique story and personal
        ambitions to fulfill in their life. I love to learn more about these
        things, and Iâ€™m not afraid to get into these topics early on!</p><p
        class="justify">Another specific thing about me is that when I hear a
        helicopter sound, I get so excited, I become a 5-year old boy. ðŸ˜‚ In the
        future, I want to become a helicopter pilot because Iâ€™m mesmerized by
        those machines and the feeling of flying. Oh and I absolutely love
        trying out every food imaginable. Egg coffee, chicken feet or insects,
        Iâ€™m not scared to try it all. So yeah,thatâ€™s me!</p>
